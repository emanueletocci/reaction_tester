The main factors influencing time are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Perception: </strong> the time your sense take to perceive the external stimulus;</p></li>
            <li><strong>Processing: </strong> the time your brain need to understand the stimulus;</li>
            <li><strong>Response: </strong> the time your body need to generate a response to the brain request.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This simple tool measures your reaction time. There are 2 different kind of tests: </p>
        <h3>Static Test</h3>
            <p>The goal of <strong>static test</strong> is to reduce the body response delay. You just have to click a box without moving the mouse.</p>
        <h3>Dynamic (aim) Test</h3>
            <p>The <strong>dynamic test</strong> measures also your visual-motor coordination. You have to click the shapes which appears in different positions on the page. This is the classic <strong>aim test/trainer</strong> used by videoplayer to improve their aim skills. Such like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/714010/Aimlabs/">this</a>.</p>
