            <p><strong><a href="https://www.cognifit.com/science/response-time?srsltid=AfmBOoqw5GKgm8LTUEjLB9p0E0WXNzjE1Xf6q7e4NEinDBbiTorn5Vpl">Reaction time</a></strong>, also known as <i>response time</i>, is the interval between perceiving a stimulus and initiating a response to it. The main factors influencing time are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Perception: </b> the time your sense take to perceive the external stimulus;</p></li>
                <li><b>Processing: </b> the time your brain need to understand the stimulus;</li>
                <li><b>Response: </b> the time your body need to generate a response to the brain request.</li>
            </ul><hr>
            <p>This simple tool measures your reaction time. There are 2 different kinds of test: </p>
            <h3>Static Test</h3>
                <p>The goal of <b><mark>"static test"</mark></b> is to reduce the body response delay. You just have to click a box without moving the mouse. You should use this test to understand how fast can you respond to a stimulus.</p>
            <h3>Dynamic (aim) Test</h3>
                <p>The <b><mark>"dynamic test"</mark></b> esteem also your <i>visual-motor coordination</i>. You have to click on the shapes that appear in different positions on the page. This is the classic <b>aim test/trainer</b> used by video-game player to improve their aiming skills. Something like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/714010/Aimlabs/">this</a>.</p>
                <p>You should use this test to improve your coordination and the reaction time to moving items. I do not recommend this test on mobile devices!</p>
